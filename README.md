### Automatic Selection Buttons


These buttons are automatically selected to apply to the current device.
They are also displayed by category. They only affect the selected category.

### How to read the difference report

- When it is thin coloured, it means the file will not be valuable to be applied.
  - For example, the file is the same as the current one, or it is older in version or modification date than the current one.
- When it is thick coloured (like tags), it means the file will be valuable to apply.
  - For example, the file is newer (version or modified) than the current one.
- Automatic selection will follow your preference from the thick coloured files.
- If you want to include the thin coloured file, you should uncheck the `Only New` checkbox.
- On default, only the selected entry will be displayed. If you want to see all entries, you should uncheck the `Only Selected` checkbox.
- Once you have made a selection and are ready to apply it, you should click the `Apply` button.

## Configuration

### Ignore files
We can configure the files to be ignored by the Usher in regular expression.
The default value is `/node_modules$` and `/.git$`.

### Non-mergeable files
We can configure the files to be non-mergeable by the Usher in regular expression.
The default value is `/bookmarks.json$`.

### Utility
- Duplicate Config folder
  - Duplicate the current config folder to the new folder.
  - Very useful when you want to create a new config folder based on the current one.
- Delete Other devices' config folder
  - This action is tremendously dangerous, but sometimes useful. This action will delete the selected config folders.
  - We cannot select the current device's folder.
  - Deleted files will be moved to the trash.
